# DictionWave 

DictionWave is a word-discovery tool that lets you surf across  the world of English language and meaning. Here's how to use it:

1. Download a word vectors file and set it up in the repository.

2. Run DictionWave, and select:
    * the size of the vocabulary you wish to load from the vectors file.
    * how many words you would like to be shown for each input.
    * a "rarity boost" factor - this will determine how common or rare the words you are shown will be.
    * a "randomness" factor - to mix up the exploration some more, and show you words you might not have seen before.

3. Enter whichever words you are curious to dive into further. 

I hope you enjoy exploring the English language with DictionWave! Here's an example of what it can do, with a 100,000 word vocabulary, 50 words per query, a rarity boost factor of 5, and a randomness factor of 0.

Please see below for more detailed instructions on how to set up this project. I also plan to deploy DictionWave as a self-contained web application in the near future.

## Setup

1. Open your terminal and clone this repostory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jhelsby/DictionWave.git 
    cd DictionWave
    ```

    Install the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

2. Download a file of word vectors, and place it at the repository root. I used `crawl-300d-2M.vec`, a freely available collection of 2 million word vectors trained on [Common Crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Crawl). You can download the model [here](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html).

3. (Optional.) Create a `blacklist.txt` file to filter out words from your data source. Since `crawl-300d-2M.vec` is raw research data collected from the web, there are a number of explicit and derogatory words included in the word vectors which you may not wish to appear when running DictionWave.

    I manually assembled my own blacklist file, but since it is primarily a list of slurs and obscenities I did not wish to host it in this repository. If you would like to use it, please contact me.

4. Run `python filter_embeddings.py` to filter out duplicates, redundant words, and any blacklisted words from your dataset. You may need to change the `input_file` variable name to match your word vectors filename.

5. Run `python main.py` and follow the instructions it provides.
